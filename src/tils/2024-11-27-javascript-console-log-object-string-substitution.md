title: 'Javascript console.log() object string substitution'
---

A common issue with Javascript's `console.log` is that if you log a template string that contains a complex JS object, you'll get a useless output:

```js
>> const obj = { test: 1 }
>> console.log(`obj=${obj}`)
obj=[object Object]
>> console.log('obj=%s', obj)
obj=[object Object]
```

I was trying to debug something and copilot suggested to use `%j` formatting which seemed promising:

```js
>> console.log('obj=%j', obj)
obj=%j
Object { test: 1 }
```

Unfortunately that was an hallucination, the `%j` isn't doing anything, and is still present in the printed string.

That got me curious, so I looked it up online and found the [dedicated MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#using_string_substitutions) with the `%o` substitution:

```js
>> console.log('obj=%o', obj)
obj=Object { test: 1 }
```
