Today, I came across a problem with type checking in a Django project which led me to use `TypeGuard` for the first time. I've heard about them in TypeScript on the [Syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm/), so I was aware of the concept, but never had a practical situation where I needed to use them in Python.

## The problem

So I was doing some refactoring to eliminate a bit of code duplication between 3 functions. As features were added, I copy-pasted the first into the second, and then later in the 3rd. I wasn't sure at the time if they were going to stay exactly the same, so copying made sense at the time. The [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is well known, but optimising too early isn't good either, and I've heard some folks say that DRY should be applied when you repeat yourself 3 times, so here we are.

The code is in a Django codebase, dealing with Django models which can be in different states. As a simplified example, there was an `Order` model, with what the customer purchased. When the order is being prepared, a lot of fields are empty, which get filled as it's being fulfilled and shipped:

```python
from django.db import models

class Order(models.Model):
    received_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
    shipped_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
    delivery_address = models.ForeignKey(
        Address,
        on_delete=models.PROTECT,
        related_name="orders",
        blank=True,
        null=True,
    )
```

My duplicated piece of code was checking for these empty fields before moving on to the main logic where the fields are needed:

```python
def send_order_shipped_email(order: Order) -> None:
    if not (
        order.received_at
        and order.shipped_at
        and order.delivery_address
    ):
        return

    context = {
        "order_id": order.id,
        "received_date": format_date(order.received_at),
        "received_time": format_time(order.received_at),
        "shipped_date": format_date(order.shipped_at),
        "shipped_time": format_time(order.shipped_at),
        "delivery_address": order.delivery_address.short_address(),
    }

    send_template_email("emails/order_shipped.html", context)
```

The last line differed depending on the shipping status, but you get the idea. So I was trying to extract the pre-conditions and the building of the context. This was my initial solution:

```python
def is_order_shipping(order: Order) -> bool:
    return bool(
        order.received_at
        and order.shipped_at
        and order.delivery_address
    )


def build_context(order: Order) -> dict[str, str]:
    if not is_order_shipping(order):
        return {}

    return {
        "order_id": order.id,
        "received_date": format_date(order.received_at),
        "received_time": format_time(order.received_at),
        "shipped_date": format_date(order.shipped_at),
        "shipped_time": format_time(order.shipped_at),
        "delivery_address": order.delivery_address.short_address(),
    }


def send_order_shipped_email(order: Order) -> None:
    context = build_context(order)
    if not context:
        return

    send_template_email("emails/order_shipped.html", context)
```

The tests passed, but mypy wasn't happy! In my `build_context` function, it complained that `received_at`, `shipped_at` and `delivery_address` may be `None`, which could happen, but I was checking for this case before using them. However, because it's done in a separate function that simply returned a `bool`, mypy wasn't able to infer that types were checked properly.

## The solution

This is where I remembered hearing about the concept of type guards. I found the [mypy docs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/type_narrowing.html#user-defined-type-guards) for it, which gives a few good examples.

However, in my case, I needed to declare that the `Order` type had some fields checked and ensured that they were not nullable. I ended up defining a specialised order type and using it as type guard argument:

```python{7-10,13}
from __future__ import annotations

import datetime as dt
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, TypeGuard

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    class ShippedOrder(Order):
        received_at: dt.datetime
        shipped_at: dt.datetime
        delivery_address: Address


def is_order_shipping(order: Order) -> TypeGuard[ShippedOrder]:
    return bool(
        order.received_at
        and order.shipped_at
        and order.delivery_address
    )
```

However, that didn't fully work, mypy complained that the Django fields were incompatible with the types of my specialised class:

```
error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "Address", base class "Order" defined the type as "ForeignKey[Address | Combinable | None, Address | None]")  [assignment]
error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "datetime", base class "Order" defined the type as "DateTimeField[str | datetime | date | Combinable | None, datetime | None]")  [assignment]
error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "datetime", base class "Order" defined the type as "DateTimeField[str | datetime | date | Combinable | None, datetime | None]")  [assignment]
```

I'm not sure how to properly resolve these yet, so I marked the fields of my `ShippedOrder` with `# type: ignore[assignment]`.

## Conclusion

The solution isn't perfect, and it can be a bit cumbersome to define these types, I'm glad there was a solution for it. I'm glad I could take the knowledge I got from a podcast mostly focused on another language and apply it to Python.
