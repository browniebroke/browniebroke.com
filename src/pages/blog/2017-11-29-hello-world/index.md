Setting up my blog using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator
and Github pages. This is using the [remote theme](https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages)
feature and is I'm trying to get up and running with [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

So far it's mostly looking good, but there are few issues with listing the posts on the home page.
I might write another post to explain in details.
