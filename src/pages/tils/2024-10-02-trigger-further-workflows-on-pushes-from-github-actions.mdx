title: 'Trigger further workflows on pushes from GitHub actions'
---

GitHub actions aren't trigger by actions from other workflows by default. If you have a workflow that pushes back changes after linting/formatting, you can get it trigger another round of CI by checking out with a GitHub token:

```yaml{3}
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
- name: Make some changes
  run: ...
- name: Push changes back
  uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v5
```
