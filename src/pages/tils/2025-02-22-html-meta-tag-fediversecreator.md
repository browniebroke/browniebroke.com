title: "HTML meta tag: fediverse:creator"
---

I came across a really nice tool to check your site meta tags,
icon, colors and RSS feeds. It's [lens.rknight.me](https://lens.rknight.me/) and found most of the infos when ran it against this site. However, it taught me about the `fediverse:creator` meta tag which I didn't know about.

I sadly don't remember how I heard about it, but this post will be how I remember it, and who knows maybe how someone else discovers it.
