# gatsby-remark-external-links

Adds the target and rel attributes to external links in markdown.

This is a vendored version of [the npm package ``](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-remark-external-links) which is has a few open issues at the moment due to dependencies not being updated.

The plugin itself is pretty small, the core of the functionality is in the dependency, so it makes sense to vendor.

## Usage

Add following to your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
        options: {
          plugins: [
          {
            resolve: "gatsby-remark-external-links",
            options: {
              target: "_self",
              rel: "nofollow"
            }
          }
          ]
        }
      },
```
